                        <p>
                            <span class="helpTopic">Description</span>
                            Scroller is designed to function similar to a teleprompter.
                            Though it can be used for various scenarios, it is especially
                            suitable for musical performers that need a simple way to
                            view scrolling song lyrics or notation. Features and usage
                            are described below. This information is presented from the
                            perspective of using Scroller for songs. If your intended
                            usage is different, mentally replace "song" with any other
                            type of text (such as "speech" or "poem") as
                            you read through the remainder of this guide.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There are a few technical notes to be aware of when using Scroller:
                            <ul>
                            <li> 
                                Scroller requires a browser that supports the HTML5 standard.
                                Most modern browsers have supported this standard for a few years,
                                so it shouldn't be a concern. If your current browser version
                                does not support HTML5, Scroller will let you know.
                            </li> 
                            <li>
                                Scroller requires that your browser is configured to allow
                                use of an HTML5 feature called Web Storage (also known as
                                local storage). If your current browser is not configured to
                                permit Web Storage, Scroller will let you know and provide
                                general guidance on setting your browser to enable Web Storage.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Since Scroller uses Web Storage, it does not require an internet
                                connection to work. All songs you enter into Scroller are
                                stored directly on your computer. This means you take Scroller
                                with you to any venue without worrying about Wi-Fi availability.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The songs Scroller stores on your computer are only accessible
                                by the browser that you used to initially enter the songs into
                                Scroller. If you need to copy your songs to another browser or
                                another computer, a way to do so is described later in this guide.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                When your browser saves data on your computer using Web Storage,
                                that data typically becomes part of the browser's cache.
                                Consequently, be aware that clearing your browser cache may
                                delete all songs previously stored by Scroller. If a need arises
                                for you to clear your browser cache, get a copy of your songs
                                before you do so. Then, after clearing your cache, you can more
                                easily re-add them in Scroller.
                            </li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <span class="helpTopic">The Main Screen</span>
                            The visual layout of the main screen consists of an area that displays
                            the title of the current song. Below it is a scrolling area that
                            displays the lyrics of the current song. At the bottom is a series of
                            horizontally arranged controls. These controls provide the following
                            capabilities:
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <span class="arrow_carrot-down_alt2"></span>

                                    Moves to the next/previous song. The current song and
                                    number of songs is displayed between the icons.

                                    Inner Icons: Starts/stops scrolling. Only one of these icons
                                    appears at any given time, depending on whether scrolling
                                    is on or off. (Tip: Pressing the space bar
                                    also starts/stops scrolling.)
                                    <br />
                                    Outer Icons: Pages the current song up/down.

                            The configuration screen appears on top of the main screen when the
                            configuration icon is clicked. It displays an ordered list of your songs
                            (after you've entered some), followed by a series of horizontally
                            arranged controls. These controls provide the ability to configure
                            Scroller as decribed below.
                            </p>

                            <ul>
                            <li>
                                <span class="arrow_carrot-down_alt2"></span>
                                <span class="arrow_carrot-up_alt2"></span>
                                <br />
                                Moves the currently selected song up/down in the list. Any song may be
                                selected by clicking on it. 
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <span class="icon_plus_alt2"></span>
                                <br />
                                Allows you to add a new song. Clicking this icon will display a text
                                area containing labels that show you where to enter the song title and
                                lyrics. It also provide an initial setting for the scroll speed and text
                                size for the song. Typically, you will enter (or copy-and-paste) the song
                                title immediately after the <span class="red">Title:</span> label, and
                                enter (or paste) the song lyrics starting on the line below the
                                <span class="red">Lyrics:</span> label. As you do so, it is important that
                                you do not alter or delete the provided labels. You can also cause
                                portions of the lyrics to be highlighted by enclosing them in brackets
                                (<span class="red">[ ]</span>). Once you have finished entering your new
                                song, click the icon at the bottom of the screen. Your new song will be
                                added to the list of songs. (Tip: you can press the Escape key to return
                                to the songs list without saving the song.)
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <span class="icon_pencil-edit_alt"></span>
                                <br />
                                Allows you to edit the currently selected song. Clicking this icon will
                                display a text area containing the song title, speed, size, and lyrics.
                                Each of these parts of the song will be marked by the same labels that
                                were provided when you first entered the song. Simply edit the song as
                                desired. When you're done, click the icon at the bottom of the screen
                                to return to the songs list. (Tip: you can press the Escape key to
                                return to the songs list without saving the song.)
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <span class="icon_trash_alt"></span>
                                <br />
                                Allows you to delete the currently selected song. You will be prompted
                                to confirm that you really want to delete the song.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <span class="icon_documents_alt"></span>
                                <br />
                                Allows you to copy all songs to your clipboard. This is useful if you want
                                to copy your songs and add them to Scroller on a different computer or in
                                a different browser. It's also a handy way to save a backup copy of your
                                songs in a separate document.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <span class="icon_close_alt2"></span>
                                <br />
                                Closes the configuration screen and returns you to Scroller's
                                main screen.
                            </li>

                                Scroller was developed by B. Martin "Marty" Hill as a
                                personal project to meet his needs as a (very) amateur
                                guitarist and singer. It is available as open source
                                software under the licensing terms given below.

                                Marty is not specifically a web developer by trade, so there are
                                doubtless improvements and simplifications that other more skilled
                                web developers might identify. They are encouraged to make such
