# Scroller
A general-purpose HTML5 text scrolling app geared toward the needs of musical performers.

Scroller is designed to function similar to a teleprompter. Though it can be used for various scenarios, it is especially suitable for musical performers that need a simple way to view scrolling song lyrics or notation. Consequently, information about Scroller is presented from the perspective of using it for songs. If your intended usage is different, mentally replace “song” with any other type of text, such as “speech” or “poem.”

Once installed and launched on your computer, the bottom of Scroller's main screen contains a help icon that, when clicked, displays the full User Guide. Scroller is fully self-contained and has no unusual requirements or dependencies. Installation is simply extracting the contents of the Scroller zip file into a file system location of your choosing. After that, you just open Scroller's index.html file in your browser. Feel free to download Scroller and have a look!

There are a few technical notes to be aware of when using Scroller:

<ul>
<li>
Scroller requires a browser that supports the HTML5 standard. Most modern browsers have supported this standard for a few years, so it shouldn’t be a concern. If your current browser version does not support HTML5, Scroller will let you know.
</li>
<li>
Scroller requires that your browser is configured to allow use of an HTML5 feature called Web Storage (also known as local storage). If your current browser is not configured to permit Web Storage, Scroller will let you know and provide general guidance on setting your browser to enable Web Storage.
</li>
<li>
Since Scroller uses local storage, it does not require an internet connection to work. All songs you enter into Scroller are stored directly on your computer. This lets you can take Scroller with you to any venue without worrying about Wi-Fi availability.
</li>
<li>
The songs Scroller stores on your computer will only be accessible by the browser that you use to initially enter the songs into Scroller. If, at a later time, you need to copy your songs to another browser or another computer, a way to do so is described in the User Guide.
</li>
<li>
When your browser saves data on your computer using Web Storage, that data typically becomes part of the browser’s cache. Consequently, be aware that clearing your browser cache may delete all songs previously stored by Scroller. If a need arises to clear your browser cache, remember to get a copy of your songs (as described in the User Guide) so you can more easily re-add them in Scroller after your cache has been cleared.
